M# FTP Client / Server Project

## Summary of Meeting 1

#### Instructions for the FTP Client implementation

-   [ ] The client should initiate a TCP connection with the server  
-   [ ] Client must be able to view any of the directories and download any of the available files via **_TCP_**
-   [ ] The client must also be able to upload files and create new directories

#### Instructions for the FTP Server implementation

-   [ ] FTP server must include at least 3 directories with 5 files each
-   [ ] Transfer files to client

#### Todo

-   [x] Create github repo
-   [x] Research the Engineering Design Process
-   [ ] Find and try to read RFC 959, and any relevant updates, to ensure that the protocol is properly implemented
-   [x] Research pros con python
-   [x] Research pros con C# .net
-   [ ] Email professor about which technology he recommends: c# .net or python.

## Summary of Meeting 2

#### Decisions made:

-   Python will be used due to  the existence of incredibly useful and simple libraries and other  FTP projects online that are similar to ours.  
-   Added Ema and Mario to the github project
-   The project will be implemented using socket libraries instead of the built in library [ftplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html).
-   Next meeting: Monday from 4pm to 5pm

#### Todo

-   [x] Email professor to ask about which Engineering Design Process (EDP) should we use. (Luis)
-   [ ] Try to finish reading RFC 959. (All)
-   [x] Download or screen-record the classes about UDP and TCP that are about to be erased, in case they are necessary in the future. (Volunteer)
-   [ ] Research the following libraries: (All)
    -   [ ] import socket
    -   [ ] import sys
    -   [ ] import os
    -   [ ] import struct
-   [ ] Check if the code in other github profiles does work (clone/test), read it, and understand it. (Volunteer)

-   Learn some GUI framework to use it for the project
-   Research how to display the file explorer from a server to the client.

#### Todo
